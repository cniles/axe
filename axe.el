;;; Commentary:

;; AWS eXtensions for Emacs.  axe is an interface for interacting with
;; AWS resources.  axe aspires to provide an Emacs-based frontend as
;; an alternative to the AWS web console.  axe also tries to provide
;; more automated workflows for many tasks that are tediously typed
;; out through the AWS CLI utility.  It provides a library for
;; implementing functions that make AWS API requests and a buffer mode
;; to easily display paged API responses in Emacs buffers.

;;; Code:
